Your tactics: 1) Maintain EMCON discipline - avoid active sonar unless you have a strong passive contact. 2) If you detect a possible submarine contact, first try to localize it passively by maneuvering to get better bearings. 3) Only use active sonar if you have a high-confidence contact and need precise targeting. 4) Only drop depth charges when you have a solid target solution within 800m. 5) Remember: active sonar and depth charges reveal your position to the enemy. 6) Coordinate with red-b-dd-01 but maintain tactical discipline. Your primary mission is convoy protection, not submarine hunting.",
